### Welcome to TrustyAI ðŸ‘‹
TrustyAI is an open source AI Explainability (XAI) Toolkit. 
It provides a Java and Python library and [Open Data Hub](https://github.com/opendatahub-io) (ODH) component for XAI explanations of predictive models for both enterprise and data science. 

The [project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/trustyai-explainability/projects/10) offers a view on new tools and integration the project developers are planning to add.

Included in the TrustyAI core library are several tools, which include:

- Local explainers
- Global explainers
- Time-series explainers
- Fairness metrics
- Drift metrics
- Language performance metrics
- KServe ([ODH](https://trustyai-explainability.github.io/trustyai-site/main/saliency-explanations.html) and [side-car](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.12/modelserving/explainer/explainer/) and ModelMesh integration

TrustyAI uses the [ODH governance model](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-community/blob/master/governance.md) and [code of conduct](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
